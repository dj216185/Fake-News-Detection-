# Fake News Detection Language Model (LLM)

## Overview
This project presents a Language Model for Fake News Detection, designed to predict the veracity of news articles. The model is trained on the WELFake_Dataset from Kaggle, which comprises over 70,000 articles.

## Features
- **Fake News Detection**: The model predicts whether a given news article is true or false.
- **Large Dataset**: Trained on a dataset of over 70,000 articles, the model has learned from a wide variety of news articles.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simply enter the text of a news article, and the model will return a prediction of its truthfulness.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script and enter the text of the news article when prompted.
4. The model will return a prediction of whether the news article is true or false.

## Future Work
We plan to continuously update the model with new data to improve its accuracy and reliability. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!

## Disclaimer
While the model strives for accuracy, no model is 100% accurate. Always cross-verify news from multiple trusted sources.
